- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dylan-bit247! You can call me Dylan!

- 👀 I’m interested in Software development, kernel development, Game Modding, and gaming!

- I first started learning how to work with code when I started modding games I played back in 8th grade! I never really though to take on programming as a job of its own until I realized mechanical engineering was not going to be for me. When I realized I would not like where I was going I ran into a programming classes and decided to try doing something I enjoy.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about kernels, I have recently switched to using Linux full time. Prior to this I have used Windows, and macOS. I still have and use my macOS laptop but my personal desktop is running Linux. While I had played with Linux since 2016 in VM's, and im not completely new, I still have a lot to learn. As for schooling I have 4 classes left, and an internship before I can graduate.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many things from resources for Linux users and other FOSS projects, to projects related to my future workplaces, and gaming if I have the time. I have used git resources a lot over the years, even more so since I made the switch to Linux, and I look forward to contributing back to the community.

- 📫 How to reach me at hibokukami@gmail.com, its the email I use for few things related to programming when I don't want to give out my personal email, but I do regularly check it when I can.
